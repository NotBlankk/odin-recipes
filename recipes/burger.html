    <h2>Discription</h2>
    <p>A cheeseburger is a hamburger with a slice of melted cheese on top of the meat patty, added near the end of the cooking time. Cheeseburgers can include variations in structure, ingredients and composition. As with other hamburgers, a cheeseburger may include various condiments and other toppings such as lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, avocado, mushrooms, mayonnaise, ketchup, and mustard.</p>

    </ul>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <p>To make a delicious cheeseburger, start by preparing the burger patties. In a bowl, mix 1 pound of ground beef (preferably 80/20 for juiciness) with 1 teaspoon of salt, ½ teaspoon of black pepper, and optional seasonings like garlic powder or onion powder for extra flavor. Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and shape them into patties. Press a small indentation in the center of each patty to prevent it from puffing up during cooking. Heat a grill or skillet over medium-high heat, then cook the patties for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until they reach your desired level of doneness. Add a slice of cheese (American, cheddar, or your preferred type) to each patty during the last minute of cooking and cover to melt.

        
    </p>
    <p>
        While the patties cook, toast your burger buns on the grill or in a toaster until golden. Once the patties are done, place them on the bottom half of each bun. Top the cheese with your favorite condiments like ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise, and add fresh toppings such as lettuce, tomato, pickles, and onions. Place the top bun on and serve immediately with a side of fries or chips for a classic cheeseburger experience.
