    <h2>Discription</h2>
    <p>Carbonara is a pasta dish made with fatty cured pork, hard cheese, eggs, salt, and black pepper.[1][2][3][4][5][6] It is typical of the Lazio region of Italy. The dish took its modern form and name in the middle of the 20th century.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pasta</li>
        <li>Sauce </li>
        <li>Optional:
            A small clove of garlic (for saut√©ing with the pancetta, if you like a hint of garlic flavor)
            A little pasta cooking water (to adjust sauce consistency, if needed)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <p>To make classic carbonara, start by boiling 400g (14 oz) of pasta (typically spaghetti) in salted water until al dente. While the pasta cooks, dice 150g (5 oz) of pancetta or guanciale and fry it in a large pan over medium heat for about 5-7 minutes until crispy. You can optionally add a small clove of garlic for extra flavor, but remove it once the pancetta is done. Reserve about 1 cup of pasta cooking water before draining the pasta, then add the hot pasta directly to the pan with the pancetta, tossing to coat the pasta with the rendered fat.

        
    </p>
    <p>
        In a bowl, whisk together 3 large eggs, 1 cup of grated Pecorino Romano cheese (or a mix of Pecorino and Parmesan), and a generous amount of freshly cracked black pepper. Remove the pan from heat, then quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta, tossing vigorously to create a creamy sauce. The residual heat will gently cook the eggs, forming the signature smooth, velvety carbonara sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add some reserved pasta water to adjust the consistency. Serve immediately with more grated cheese and pepper on top. Enjoy your rich, authentic carbonara!

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta (about 400g or 14 oz) and cook according to package instructions until al dente. Save about 1 cup of pasta water before draining.
Cook the Pancetta/Guanciale:

        <li>    
            While the pasta cooks, heat a large pan over medium heat. Add the diced pancetta or guanciale (150g or 5 oz) to the pan and cook for 5-7 minutes, until it becomes crispy and golden. You can also add a small clove of garlic at this stage for extra flavor, then remove it once the pancetta is done.
Make the Carbonara Sauce:


        </li>

        <li>        
            In a bowl, whisk together 3 large eggs and 1 cup of grated Pecorino Romano cheese (or a mix of Pecorino and Parmesan). Season with freshly cracked black pepper (a generous amount). Set the bowl aside.
Combine Pasta and Sauce:


        </li>

        <li> 
            Once the pasta is done, drain it (reserving some pasta water). Immediately add the hot pasta to the pan with the crispy pancetta or guanciale. Toss well to coat the pasta with the rendered fat.
Finish the Carbonara:


        </li>

        <li> 
            Remove the pan from heat and quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta. Toss everything vigorously to create a creamy sauce. The residual heat from the pasta and pancetta will cook the eggs gently, creating a smooth and velvety sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add a bit of the reserved pasta water to reach your desired consistency.
Serve:


        </li>
        
        <li> 
            Serve immediately, topped with more grated Pecorino and freshly cracked black pepper.
