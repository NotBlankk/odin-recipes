    <h2>Discription</h2>
    <p>Pizza is an Italian dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomato, cheese, and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Dough</li>
        <li>Sauce (usually tomato sauce)</li>
        <li>Cheese (typically mozzarella)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <p>To make a simple pizza, start by preparing the dough. In a large bowl, combine 2 ½ cups of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 tablespoon of sugar, and 1 tablespoon of active dry yeast. Gradually add 1 cup of warm water (around 110°F) and 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Mix everything together until a dough forms, then knead for about 5-7 minutes until smooth. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rise for about 1 hour or until doubled in size. Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C).
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the dough has risen, punch it down and roll it out into a circle or rectangle, depending on your pan shape. Transfer the dough to a lightly greased baking sheet or pizza stone. Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce on the base, then sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese. Add your favorite toppings like pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, olives, or onions. Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned. Slice and enjoy your homemade pizza!
